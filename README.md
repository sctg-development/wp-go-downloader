## Process Overview

The tool performs the following steps:

1. Downloads the initial HTML page
2. Parses HTML to extract all URLs (scripts, images, CSS, links)
3. Downloads all assets concurrently within the concurrency limit
4. Recursively processes any HTML pages found during download
5. Post-processes HTML and CSS files for offline functionality
6. Removes tracking scripts and optimizes files
7. Saves the complete website to the specified output directory

## Limitations

- No support for content loaded dynamically via AJAX
- Cannot execute JavaScript to render dynamic content
- Not compatible with single-page applications (SPAs)
- Limited functionality with complex frontend frameworks
- May require adjustments for heavily customized WordPress sites
